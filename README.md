# RLexp
The is the code for the **Experiments of Reinforcement Learning**, which will be mainly written by C++ and Python.

## Reinforcement learning codes

* **Ex1** classic n-bandit problems
	- This problem contains a bandit with n arms, each generate a normal distribution reward.
	- Three policies will be implemented: i.e. *Greedy Policy*, *Îµ-Greedy Policy*, *Gradient Policy*.
	- Simulation results will be displayed by Python.
